SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
====================

- MPI library
- Text parser library
- Performance monitor library
- Polygon management library
- Cut information library
- Tools for Building-cube method
- Hierarchical data management library


HOW TO BUILD
============

*** Only "manual build" is available in this release. ***
*** Sorry for the inconvenience.                      ***


0. Move to the FFV source directory
-----------------------------------

    $cd FFV-HC/src


1. Edit make_setting
-----------------------------------

1.1 Specify the path to each library.

    * For MPI library.  Ex) Ubuntu Linux
      MPI_DIR     := /usr/lib/opnmpi

    * For FFV softwares.
      FFV_HOME    := $(HOME)/FFV

      TPLIB       := $(FFV_HOME)/TextParser
      POLYLIB     := $(FFV_HOME)/Polylib
      CUTLIB      := $(FFV_HOME)/Cutlib
      PMLIB       := $(FFV_HOME)/PMlib
      BCM_DIR     := $(FFV_HOME)/BCMTools
      HDMLIB      := $(FFV_HOME)/HDMlib

1.2 Select the compiler to use.

    * For GNU compiler
      FFV_COMP    := gnu

    * For Intel compiler
      FFV_COMP    := intel

    * For Fujitsu compiler (K/FX10)
      FFV_COMP    := fx

    * For PGI compiler (!!CATION!! experimental)
      FFV_COMP    := pgi

1.3 Select the precision for floating number operations.

    * For single-precision
      FFV_REAL    := float

    * For double-precision
      FFV_REAL    := double

1.4 Select the loops to be parallelized using OpenMP.

    * Block-loops. For grids with a large number of blocks.
			FFV_THREAD  := BLOCK

    * IJK-loops. For grids with a large number of cells.
			FFV_THREAD  := IJK

2. Compilation
--------------

2.1 Execute the following command.

    $ make

    If the compilation succeeds,
    the executable module, named "ffv", is generated in FFV/bin.
