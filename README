OUTLINE
=======

FFV-HC is an experimental branch of FFV, which aims at effective control of grid density
by using hierarchical Cartesian grids. 

In FFV-HC, a block-based octree data structure
is employed to organize Cartesian grids. Thanks to this data structure, it is possible
to share basic algorithms for the computation of fluid dynamics with FFV-C, and thus
the key features are still retained - high performance on massively parallel computers.

CAUTION
=======

This is a prototype version of FFV-HC.
Compared with FFV-C, less functions are implemented and available for use.
A regular version with full functionality, and less bugs, will be released in April 2014.
