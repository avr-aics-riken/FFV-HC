OUTLINE
=======

FFV-HC is an experimental branch of FFV, which aims at effective control of grid density
by using hierarchical Cartesian grids. 

In FFV-HC, a block-based octree data structure
is employed to organize Cartesian grids. Thanks to this data structure, it is possible
to share basic algorithms for the computation of fluid dynamics with FFV-C, and thus
the key features are still retained - high performance on massively parallel computers.


CAUTION
=======

This is a prototype version of FFV-HC Version 2.
