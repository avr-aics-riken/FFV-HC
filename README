OUTLINE
=======

FrontFlow/violet (FFV) provides numerical solutions for 3D transient fluid flow
and heat transfer problems encountered in practical engineering applications.
Based on Cartesian grid techniques, it offers several advantages over conventional
solvers including:

- High accuracy
- High performance computation with good scalability
- High portability of the source codes (from personal computers to supercomputers)
- High consistency with pre-/post-processing
  Ex) Fully parallel and automatic grid generation function is built-in

Thus, FFV aims at reducing the total turnaround time in the design cycle for
industrial products.

FFV-Hierarchical Cartesian (FFV-HC) is an experimental branch of FFV, and is developed
to work on hierarchical Cartesian grids. In FFV-HC, a block-based octree data structure
is employed to organize hierarchical Cartesian grids. Thanks to this data structure,
it is possible to share basic algorithms for the computation of fluid dynamics with FFV-C,
and thus the key features are still retained.


RELEASE PLAN
============

FFV-HC is still being under extensive development, and will be released with new features.
Please note, however, that such new features are implemented in the next version (ver 2.x.x),
which will be released by the end of March in 2015. 
This version (ver 1.x.x) will be updated only for bug fixes.

[NEW FEATURES]
- An enhanced immersed boundary method for moving boundaries
- A new solver for two-phase flows in complex geometries
  and so on.
